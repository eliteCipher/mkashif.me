# **About Me**

Hi, :wave: <br><br>
Thanks for stumbling upon my little space on the web. Currently, I have a Master's in Cybersecurity from University of Saarland and over four years of experience in the Security Operation Centre. I am passionate about Defensive security, Threat hunting, and startups. 

I like breaking things up and then trying to build them back together. Hence, I spent most of time simulating cyber attacks in my <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/eliteCipher/Threat-Detection">home lab setup</a>, and looking for non conventional methods to detect them in Defensive system.

Beyond technical skills, trekking in remote areas has taught me to navigate unknown terrain, a skill that prepared me for threat hunting in a SIEM environment. Similarly, my approach to enhance governance and compliance by integrating multiple cybersecurity frameworks is a reflection of my cooking skills, where flavour is the result of many spices coming together in the perfect balance. These hobbies keep me grounded and remind me that diverse perspectives produce diverse ideas.

The best way to connect with me is by shooting me an <a href="mailto:md.kashif8858@gmail.com">email</a>. My public key is <a target="_blank" href="https://keybase.io/">3E0F </a>. Do it without thinking twice. I love socializing.
