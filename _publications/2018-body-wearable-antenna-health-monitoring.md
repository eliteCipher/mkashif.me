This paper proposes a textile microstrip patch antenna operating at 2.54 GHz in the ISM band for integration into an online real-time health monitoring system. The antenna achieves a return loss of about –44 dB and a directivity of 5.642 dBi, making it suitable for wearable medical applications. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
