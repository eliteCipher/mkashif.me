This work introduces a compiler that translates Haskell (via Clash) into Boolean circuits suitable for evaluation with TFHE and investigates automatic layer-based circuit parallelisation. The authors demonstrate competitive performance on AES and private information retrieval benchmarks, achieving significant speedups with multi-threaded evaluation. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
