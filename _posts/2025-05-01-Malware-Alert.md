# 🚨 Malware Alert🚨 

Hello, my fellow Cybersecurity Geeks! 
Are you also wondering how to approach in case of a malware file detected in your environment?

#### Step 1: DON’T EXECUTE! 

Congrats! You just saved yourself from a catastrophe. Now, let’s focus on containing and eradicating the malware.

But hold on... what if it has already spread to other machines? 
No worries! Let’s build a YARA rule to detect and track it.

#### YARA - The Malware Hunter’s Tool
YARA is a powerful tool for identifying and classifying malware by creating rules based on textual or binary patterns. 

#### YarGen - Automating Rule Creation
It's a tedious task to write YARA rules manually. That’s where YarGen comes in. It automatically generates a YARA rule for you by scanning the malicious file and excluding known good code to reduce false positives.

#### Loki - Scanning for IOCs and YARA Matches
Once your YARA rules are ready, use Loki to scan files and directories for Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) and YARA rule matches. 

A good threat hunter knows the importance of these tools. Have you tried YARA in your investigations? Share your experiences!
