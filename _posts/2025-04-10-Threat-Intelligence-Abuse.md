Often, we get lost on the internet searching for the credible threat intelligence tools. Well, Institue for Cybersecurity and Engineering at  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bfh.ch/en/research/research-areas/institute-for-cybersecurity-and-engineering-ice/">Berner Fachhochschule BFH</a> in Switzerland came for the rescue for overwhelmed SOC Analysts like us.

They developed a project, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bfh.ch/en/research/research-areas/institute-for-cybersecurity-and-engineering-ice/">Abuse.ch</a> (don’t worry, nothing abusive here!  :P) to identify and track malware and botnets through several operational platforms developed under the project. 

These platforms are:
### 1. <a target="_blank" href="https://bazaar.abuse.ch/api/">Malware Bazaar</a>: 
A resource for sharing malware samples.

### 2. <a target="_blank" href="https://feodotracker.abuse.ch/">Feodo Tracker</a>: 
A resource used to track botnet command and control (C2) infrastructure linked with Emotet, Dridex and TrickBot.

### 3. <a target="_blank" href="https://sslbl.abuse.ch/">SSL Blacklist</a>: 
A resource for collecting and providing a blocklist for malicious SSL certificates and JA3/JA3s fingerprints.

### 4. <a target="_blank" href="https://urlhaus.abuse.ch/">URL Haus</a>: 
A resource for sharing malware distribution sites.

### 5. <a target="_blank" href="https://threatfox.abuse.ch/">Threat Fox</a>: 
A resource for sharing indicators of compromise (IOCs).

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.bfh.ch/en/research/research-areas/institute-for-cybersecurity-and-engineering-ice/">Abuse.ch</a> is a goldmine for threat hunters, SOC analysts, and cybersecurity researchers. Have you used it in your investigations?
