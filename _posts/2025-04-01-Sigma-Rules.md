Struggling to remember the ever-changing query syntax across different SIEM platforms? You’re not alone! Every tool—Splunk, Elastic, Sentinel—has its own scripting language, making threat detection a challenge.

But don’t worry—SIGMA rules are here to save the day! 🚀

SIGMA is the Swiss knife of writing detection queries in SIEM, you write a single detection rule and convert it into queries for your favourite SIEM tool. No more memorizing multiple syntaxes—just write once and translate as needed.

## Want to detect BloodHound in your environment? 
Here’s my git repository for an example of a SIGMA rule in action: <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/eliteCipher/Threat-Detection">Threat Detection</a> 

Threat detection just got easier! Are you using SIGMA in your SOC? Let me know your thoughts!
